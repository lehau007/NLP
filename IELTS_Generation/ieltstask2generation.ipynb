      "Prompt: Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.\n",
      "Essay: People have different views on whether a government should support the elderly and retired people financially or not. I believe that it is mostly an individual’s duty to save funds for their retirement, but I totally disagree that elderly people shouldn't receive any support from the state. The combination of personal support and the government’s assistance could be the best possible solution for the retired elderly people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the regime should support the elderly people financially as this is the part of a social democracy which states the equality of opportunities and distribution of resources fairly. For example, many developed countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United State are following this strategy by allowing some money to be cashed for elderly people upon their retirement. Moreover, it is their right to have some financial support as they had paid their taxes throughout their lives. So they have to take some of their money back when they need it. The government should allocate money to take care of its citizens no matter what are their ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side, those elderly people do not have any alternative way of earning, as their chances for employment is quite low in contrast to the young people, they should be taken care by the savings they have, by their own children and by the government. \n",
      "\n",
      "The people should always have savings and relatives who would be taking care of them when they become old. The parents take care of their kids and sacrifice a lot. The children should always be ready to take care of their elder parents. A prudent person would have some savings for his older years and thus it is also an individual’s obligation to save for their future need. Furthermore, the government can’t deny its role to take care of the elder people. The combination of these three can be very effective to take care of people when they become old.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, governments should take the responsibility of providing senior citizens with all their financial needs as part of  ensuring their well-being and at the same time it is an individual's duty  to save money for their hardest time  and their sons and daughters have some responsibilities as well.\n",
      "Prompt: Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n",
      "Essay: The issues related to teenagers are always the top concern of the entire society. Some people believe that it is beneficial for more young adolescents to do compulsory volunteer community work. However, in my perspective, every teenager is unique and has his/her own way to be better, which means we need to combine various ways to help them to achieve a more promising future rather than a single fixed form. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Frankly, every teenager needs guidance amid his/her own growth. Being required to commit to  unpaid community work has some possibilities that may bring out the brighter side of each kid, such as being more caring and responsible. Examples of this mindset are numerous. For instance, plenty of delinquents in the US will be assigned to required social work after those hard times in jail to further realize that the peace and prospect of the community cannot be achieved without everyone’s efforts. Such an act therefore may be conducive to arising their sense of responsibility. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But every coin has two sides. Trying to help teenagers by forcing them to do something that they may not like can have a totally reverse effect. As different teenagers have different characteristics, some of them may have their own way of better understanding the welfare of the community. For example, parents from increasing Chinese families are encouraging their kids to explore their own interests to fully develop them. This way can help those teenagers who might’ve been lost in the simple pleasure of causing damage to surrounding people to find the optimal way to fulfil their own social responsibilities. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In conclusion, doing community work surely has some benefits to shaping one teenager into a better person. But it’s also important to understand that once these young souls find the right path, which can be gained through education or life lessons, they will play a greater role in building our society.\n"

      "Prompt: Some people believe that the government should not spend money on international aid when they have their own disadvantaged people like homeless and unemployed. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n",
      "Essay: Some individuals suppose that the government should allocate financial resources to other impoverished countries while others believe that it is of paramount importance to focus on solving their domestic issues. From my point of view, I strongly agree with the proposal of determining national priority on internal problems.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the one hand, it is undeniable that cross-border support is a symbol of humanity. Geographically, people are divided into different ethnicities but by nature, it will be the core of connecting features among individuals. Thus, aiding the poor stems from the consciousness and heart of each resident and is not solely contingent on monetary contributions. Not to mention that helping other nations to encounter  financial crises would eliminate the chances of illegal migration which is detrimental to surrounding developed regions. For example, back to the COVID-19 pandemic, with  assistance from the whole world related to foods, vaccines,... etc, leading to a sustainable society as well as expressing humanity among several nations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that concentrating on addressing domestic issues such as homelessness or unemployment should be of the utmost urgency in any country. To begin with, the financial fund from the government is regarded as a crucial means to reserve and maintain welfare schemes as well as social security. The smooth flow of how society works would generate a favourable environment for employment opportunities which accordingly increases the economic growth rate. Furthermore, employment prospects, consequently, generate more personal budgets which people can use to afford decent accommodation decreasing the homelessness rate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In conclusion, although transnational support should be executed as a gesture of humanity, I still believe that the government should put the goal of tackling internal issues in a country to be the top priority.\n"

      " While the use of Artificial Intelligence in our daily lives has become an increasingly popular topic of debate, it is important to recognize the benefits it brings to society. This essay will explore some of the significant benefits AI has brought to society and shed light on the potential pitfalls it may pose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As technology advances, artificial intelligence has become increasingly sophisticated and sophisticated at the same time. While there are a variety of benefits that AI has brought to people, I believe that the most significant benefits have come from its potential for abuse. For example, AI can be manipulated to mimic human behaviors that are not necessarily based on logic and reason. This poses a threat to the civil liberties of citizens and has even led to the potential for civil unrest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Conversely, AI can also be utilized for good, especially in areas that require human empathy, such as education and healthcare. For example, AI can be used in education to teach students to recognise and empathize with their peers, potentially saving time and money in the classroom. In addition, AI can be used to provide healthcare to patients, saving time and money in the hospital.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In conclusion, AI has brought significant benefits to society and should be used to its full potential. While there are risks to its misuse, I believe that the benefits that AI has brought to society outweigh the potential downsides. Therefore, I believe that AI is a crucial part of our modern civilization and should be embraced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To sum up, I believe that the rise of artificial intelligence has been a boon to society and that its potential for misuse should not be underestimated. Nevertheless, I believe that its potential for abuse should not be overlooked either. Therefore, I strongly advocate that it is important for society to educate themselves to avoid the potential downsides of AI.\r\n",

      " One of the most urgent issues facing the world today is the ever-increasing number of air pollution. While some individuals believe that the best solution to tackle this problem is to raise fuel prices, others believe that there are other solutions that could be equally effective. In my opinion, while the rise in fuel prices can have some beneficial effects on air quality, I believe that there are other measures that can also be effective.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To begin with, the rise in fuel costs can help to reduce the amount of pollution that is released into the environment. In other words, it is very expensive to transport fuel across the globe, so people have to cut down on their use of private cars, which are the primary drivers of air pollution. For example, in developed countries like the United States, Singapore and other developed nations, the cost of fuel has risen over the last few decades, and people have to pay more for their transport. This has led to less pollution in the atmosphere, and the increase in fuel prices can help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the other hand, there are other measures that can also be effective in tackling global environmental problems. The first measure would be to invest in renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy. These sources are environmentally friendly, and they do not release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For example, in Germany, the government has recently allocated a huge amount of money to invest in wind energy, which is an environmentally friendly source of energy that does not release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. As a result, wind energy production has been significantly increasing in Germany over the last few years, and the level of air pollution has declined considerably.\r\n",

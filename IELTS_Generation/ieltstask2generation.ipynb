      "Prompt: Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.\n",
      "Essay: People have different views on whether a government should support the elderly and retired people financially or not. I believe that it is mostly an individual’s duty to save funds for their retirement, but I totally disagree that elderly people shouldn't receive any support from the state. The combination of personal support and the government’s assistance could be the best possible solution for the retired elderly people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the regime should support the elderly people financially as this is the part of a social democracy which states the equality of opportunities and distribution of resources fairly. For example, many developed countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United State are following this strategy by allowing some money to be cashed for elderly people upon their retirement. Moreover, it is their right to have some financial support as they had paid their taxes throughout their lives. So they have to take some of their money back when they need it. The government should allocate money to take care of its citizens no matter what are their ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side, those elderly people do not have any alternative way of earning, as their chances for employment is quite low in contrast to the young people, they should be taken care by the savings they have, by their own children and by the government. \n",
      "\n",
      "The people should always have savings and relatives who would be taking care of them when they become old. The parents take care of their kids and sacrifice a lot. The children should always be ready to take care of their elder parents. A prudent person would have some savings for his older years and thus it is also an individual’s obligation to save for their future need. Furthermore, the government can’t deny its role to take care of the elder people. The combination of these three can be very effective to take care of people when they become old.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, governments should take the responsibility of providing senior citizens with all their financial needs as part of  ensuring their well-being and at the same time it is an individual's duty  to save money for their hardest time  and their sons and daughters have some responsibilities as well.\n",
      "Prompt: Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n",
      "Essay: The issues related to teenagers are always the top concern of the entire society. Some people believe that it is beneficial for more young adolescents to do compulsory volunteer community work. However, in my perspective, every teenager is unique and has his/her own way to be better, which means we need to combine various ways to help them to achieve a more promising future rather than a single fixed form. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Frankly, every teenager needs guidance amid his/her own growth. Being required to commit to  unpaid community work has some possibilities that may bring out the brighter side of each kid, such as being more caring and responsible. Examples of this mindset are numerous. For instance, plenty of delinquents in the US will be assigned to required social work after those hard times in jail to further realize that the peace and prospect of the community cannot be achieved without everyone’s efforts. Such an act therefore may be conducive to arising their sense of responsibility. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But every coin has two sides. Trying to help teenagers by forcing them to do something that they may not like can have a totally reverse effect. As different teenagers have different characteristics, some of them may have their own way of better understanding the welfare of the community. For example, parents from increasing Chinese families are encouraging their kids to explore their own interests to fully develop them. This way can help those teenagers who might’ve been lost in the simple pleasure of causing damage to surrounding people to find the optimal way to fulfil their own social responsibilities. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In conclusion, doing community work surely has some benefits to shaping one teenager into a better person. But it’s also important to understand that once these young souls find the right path, which can be gained through education or life lessons, they will play a greater role in building our society.\n"

      "Prompt: Some people believe that the government should not spend money on international aid when they have their own disadvantaged people like homeless and unemployed. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n",
      "Essay: Some individuals suppose that the government should allocate financial resources to other impoverished countries while others believe that it is of paramount importance to focus on solving their domestic issues. From my point of view, I strongly agree with the proposal of determining national priority on internal problems.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the one hand, it is undeniable that cross-border support is a symbol of humanity. Geographically, people are divided into different ethnicities but by nature, it will be the core of connecting features among individuals. Thus, aiding the poor stems from the consciousness and heart of each resident and is not solely contingent on monetary contributions. Not to mention that helping other nations to encounter  financial crises would eliminate the chances of illegal migration which is detrimental to surrounding developed regions. For example, back to the COVID-19 pandemic, with  assistance from the whole world related to foods, vaccines,... etc, leading to a sustainable society as well as expressing humanity among several nations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that concentrating on addressing domestic issues such as homelessness or unemployment should be of the utmost urgency in any country. To begin with, the financial fund from the government is regarded as a crucial means to reserve and maintain welfare schemes as well as social security. The smooth flow of how society works would generate a favourable environment for employment opportunities which accordingly increases the economic growth rate. Furthermore, employment prospects, consequently, generate more personal budgets which people can use to afford decent accommodation decreasing the homelessness rate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In conclusion, although transnational support should be executed as a gesture of humanity, I still believe that the government should put the goal of tackling internal issues in a country to be the top priority.\n"

In other words, AI is an artificial intelligence that can easily replace human labour. Secondly, it is a matter of improving the quality of education. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons for both these factors.\r\n",

      "Firstly, Artificial Intelligence can be considered as a replacement for human labour. When people work with AI, they are performing repetitive tasks which results in a reduction in the quality of education. For example, when the number of pupils in school increases, so does the number of teachers. Therefore, the quality of education will be reduced.\r\n",

      "Secondly, the quality of education will be improved with the advancement of AI. This will help to increase the productivity of the workforce. To illustrate this, AI can be used to teach students in a school and these teachers will be replaced by AI. Consequently, the number of teachers will rise, and the quality of education will be improved.\r\n",

      "To begin with, the number of people who use personal vehicles is increasing due to the cost of fuel. In other words, people have to spend more money to travel to work or school. In order to reduce the burden on the government, the ministry should invest in public transport services, such as buses, trains or subways, that provide passengers with more comfortable and convenient transportation. In addition to this, people also need to use public transport to work and school, which can provide them with a good quality of life. Moreover, they can also use public transport on their own time to save money, and can earn more money.\r\n",

In addition, there are many people who need some volunteer work to sustain their current financial status. For instance, a lot of people can not afford to pay for school fees. However, their child will help them by doing some unpaid work to earn money and pay for their schooling. \r\n",

This can lead to a better atmosphere in the neighbourhood which will benefit both sides. For example, when the teenagers have some time to themselves they can learn some skills that will help them in their future careers. For this reason, if all the teenagers have some time to themselves, they will be able to learn how to use their skills and help their community.\r\n",
